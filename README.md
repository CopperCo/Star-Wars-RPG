# Star-Wars-RPG

I am creating a fun and interactive game for web browsers. It will dynamically update the HTML pages with the jQuery library.

This is the Week 4 assignment from the UTM Full Stack Developer Bootcamp. I was tasked to create a game which will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS and powered by my JQuery and JavaScript code.

## Tools Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla Javascript
  - Variables
  - Event Listeners
  - Functions
  - If/Else Statements
    -JQuery
  - Click Events
  - Updating the DOM

## How to Play:

When the game loads you will be able to select from 4 Star Wars Characters. Each fighter has an Attack Score, Health Points and a possible Counter Attack.

You must defeat the 3 enermies to be crowned the strongers fighter.
